# Getting logs from Splunk in the expected format


1. Get host logs
    - Splunk Query: `host=DC | eval epoch_time = coalesce(strptime(UtcTime, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N"), _time)`
    - Replace `DC` with host name of your targeted machine
    - The `eval epoch_time =...` statement uses the most precise time available and converts it
    - Export to CSV

2. [Optional] Get Atomic Red Team attack log
    - Splunk Query: `get_attack_data | eval epoch_time = coalesce(strptime(UtcTime, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N"), _time)`
    - Export to CSV
    - This log is used with label_event_log.py to auto-label attacks generated by Atomic Red Team
